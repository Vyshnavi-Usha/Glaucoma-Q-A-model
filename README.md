# Glaucoma-Q-A-model
This is a LLM model for Q&A based bot for glaucoma disease.

I have attched the Q&A that was used for training the model

Requirements:

Python 3.x

NLTK

scikit-learn

pandas

Machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and Support Vector Classification (SVC) to process and predict responses are employed

The bot uses NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for tokenization and BLEU score calculation to evaluate response quality.
